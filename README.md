# Temple Raider

This is a short 3D experience I made as a final project for "Constructing the Moving Image" at Georgia Tech. The project
involved using Unity (C#), Blender, and Photoshop to create a storyboard for the experience, some models for it, and then
making it interactive through Unity. The project is meant to be a complete and polished experience and features complex
models, lighting, and sound effects.

You play the role of an adventurer exploring a jungle temple for treasure, solving simple physics and jumping puzzles
to reach the treasure room, and then dodging deadly traps as you escape. There is a cutscene midway through the
adventure which was a learning process for me as I had never done that in a project before. This was also my first
experience with level design focused on the visuals of the experience rather than the mechanics. I had to design a 
system to divide the level into sections and shape the level such that the player could only ever see a few sections
at a time so that the others could be disabled to maintain performance. The player character's model is handmade and
rigged to an animated skeleton I ripped off of a Unity demo and considering I had no prior experience character 
modeling, nor retargeting animations from one model to another I learned a lot in that process and I'm proud of the 
result. I also learned a lot about streamlining Unity's import process for models, lighting, performance debugging,
and how Unity's rendering system works.

The built game is too large for GitHub, so you can download it at the link below if you're interested.
